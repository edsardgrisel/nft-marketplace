________TODO________:
    - thegraph bug when you list an nft and then sell it and then later list it again, thegraph will show the nft as and active listing with buyer as the previous buyer/ current seller. Also, buyer==seller.

invariants:
    1. An nft must be owned by the contract in order for its price in the mapping "s_nftPrice" to be non zero.

i can remove paidBackOrForeclosed from the pawn struct and just check if the borrower is the zero address in the pawn struct to determine if the pawn is active or not.
